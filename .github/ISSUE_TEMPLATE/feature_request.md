You can offer any ideas for improving current or adding new features.

All of them will be considered, but please keep in mind the following points:
- The emulator is under development (WIP), so most games do not work or show only the initial splash screen or menu. All issues of the form “Game X shows a black screen” will be transferred to the Testing section for testing future versions of the emulator
- Emulation speed is slow (should be fixed with 0.13 release)
- The quality of the graphics emulation is also not very (0.14)
- Currently, it does not support the build and launch on other operating systems except Windows. And I don’t really want to add support for other OSes, since the source code risks becoming a begemoth
